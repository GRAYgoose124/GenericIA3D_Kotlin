TODO: separate sim from genericagent !!!
    pass agents to sim? the point is to make sim generic for many 3d apps.
TODO: !! Make a electronegative calc/sim for molecules.
TODO: plasmodium molds (pheremones + box marching diffusion?)
TODO: separate project Game where you have generic agents that you can buff arpg style skilltree+gear, then xcom style control in 3d space.

octree 3d space sorting
Composable
Generic agents (ex. pathfinding .boids)
Rulesets: Pathers, mesh crawlers, chasers, seekers, gradient surfers, procedural objective chains 
Bees n trees
Slime mold (3d box march diffusion eventually)

Change trail to beginshape{vertices}endshape 
Gradient fields (attractors pheremone, em diffusion etc)

later: for beyond see gfxSandbox
Collision meshes + procedural gen
Physics
Attractors
3rd person control player agent
